# Contributing

The main branch is protected so this will help teach you about branches, pull requests and merging, it's really quite simple!
EDIT: There are now some useful links in the readme for new git users.

Here, you can do whatever you want in your branch!

You can start by making a branch:

Now you have a copy of the code! In the terminal you can switch with: `git branch <branch name>`

Your IDE should also give you warnings and instructions about merging as well.
GitHub has instructions for merging:

Just replace Asterisk-... with the bracnch you made.

Now find out that they don't work on this repo as main is protected and just end up using the button!

Markdown basics:
Taken from memory and [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

> quote  

\- *Ast3risk-ops*  

Headings:  


# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6


To create spacings: put 2 spaces and a newline after text.  
You *can* put inline HTML but that is not recommended.  

\* puts real asterisks instead of italics *

## Final Note

Oh, don't use the backslashes I used in the non-examples eection, those are used so that github doesn't auto format the text into headings, links and such.
Now you're ready to have free reign over the repo!

Just remember to HAVE FUN!

Let's see what this becomes...
